# PyPID_mvn
This repository implements the PID (Partial Information Decomposition) for MultiVariate Normal (MVN) systems measuring the redundancy using the Iccs measure developed by Ince (2017)  https://doi.org/10.3390/e19070318

Right now this implementation works only for the bivariate case (two sources and one target)
